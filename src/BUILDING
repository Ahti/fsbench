First, open CMakeLists.txt and check if you want to edit some options.

Then, regular CMake.
If you're new to CMake, read http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html

Please note that on some platforms the default CMake compilation mode is with optimisations disabled.
To make sure they are enabled,
a) if you're using command line, pass a flag to cmake:

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

i.e.

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .

b) if you're using GUI, set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE variable to 'Release' (w/out quotes).
