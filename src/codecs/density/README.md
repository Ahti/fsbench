It is possible to run yours using [this project](https://github.com/quixdb/squash).

Build
-----
DENSITY is fully C99 compliant and can therefore be built on a number of platforms. You need a C compiler (gcc, clang ...), and a *make* utility.

Just *cd* into the density directory, then run the following command :
> make

And that's it !

Output format
-------------
DENSITY outputs compressed data in a simple format, which enables file storage and optional parallelization for both compression and decompression.
Inside the main header and footer, a number of blocks can be found, each having its own header and footer.
Inside each block, compressed data has a structure determined by the compression algorithm used.

API
---
DENSITY features a *stream API* which is very simple to use, yet powerful enough to keep users' creativity unleashed.
Please see the *quick start* at the bottom of this page.

About the algorithms
--------------------

**Copy** ( *DENSITY_COMPRESSION_MODE_COPY* )

This is not a so-to-speak algorithm as the name implies. It embeds data inside the density block structures.
It can be used to quickly add integrity checks to input data, but it has another important purpose inside each block : if data is marked as incompressible using the target algorithm, a mode reversion occurs and copy mode is instead used for the remainder of the block.
On the next block the target algorithm is tried again.

**Chameleon** ( *DENSITY_COMPRESSION_MODE_CHAMELEON_ALGORITHM* )

This is a dictionary lookup based compression algorithm. It is designed for absolute speed and usually reaches a ~60% compression ratio on compressible data.
Decompression is just as fast. This algorithm is a great choice when main concern is speed.

**Mandala** ( *DENSITY_COMPRESSION_MODE_MANDALA_ALGORITHM* )

This algorithm was developed in conjunction with Piotr Tarsa (https://github.com/tarsa).
It uses swapped double dictionary lookups and predictions. It can be extremely good with highly compressible data (ratio reaching ~5% or less).
On typical compressible data compression ratio is ~50% or less. It is still extremely fast for both compression and decompression and is a great, efficient all-rounder algorithm.

Quick start (a simple example using the API)
--------------------------------------------
Using DENSITY in your application couldn't be any simpler.

First you need to include the 2 following files in your project :

* density_api.h
* density_api_data_structures.h

When this is done you can start using the **DENSITY API** :

    #include "density_api.h"
    #include "density_api_data_structures.h"

    #define MY_TEXT "This is a simple example on how to use Density API bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla"
    #define BUFFER_SIZE 16384
    
    ...
    
    uint8_t *outCompressed = (uint8_t *) malloc(BUFFER_SIZE * sizeof(uint8_t));
    uint8_t *outDecompressed = (uint8_t *) malloc(BUFFER_SIZE * sizeof(uint8_t));

    // We create the stream using the standard malloc and free functions
    density_stream* stream = density_stream_create(NULL, NULL);
    DENSITY_STREAM_STATE streamState;
    
    // Let's compress our text, using the Chameleon algorithm (extremely fast compression and decompression)
    if ((streamState = density_stream_prepare(stream, (uint8_t *) TEXT, strlen(TEXT), outCompressed, BUFFER_SIZE)))
        fprintf(stderr, "Error %i when preparing compression\n", streamState);
    if ((streamState = density_stream_compress_init(stream, DENSITY_COMPRESSION_MODE_CHAMELEON_ALGORITHM, DENSITY_BLOCK_TYPE_DEFAULT)))
        fprintf(stderr, "Error %i when initializing compression\n", streamState);
    if ((streamState = density_stream_compress_continue(stream)))  if (streamState != DENSITY_STREAM_STATE_STALL_ON_INPUT)
        fprintf(stderr, "Error %i occured during compression\n", streamState);
    if ((streamState = density_stream_compress_finish(stream)))
        fprintf(stderr, "Error %i occured while finishing compression\n", streamState);
    printf("%llu bytes >> %llu bytes\n", *stream->in_total_read, *stream->out_total_written);

    // Now let's decompress it, using the density_stream_output_available_for_use() method to know how many bytes were made available
    if ((streamState = density_stream_prepare(stream, outCompressed, density_stream_output_available_for_use(stream), outDecompressed, BUFFER_SIZE)))
        fprintf(stderr, "Error %i when preparing decompression\n", streamState);
    if ((streamState = density_stream_decompress_init(stream, NULL)))
        fprintf(stderr, "Error %i when initializing decompression\n", streamState);
    if ((streamState = density_stream_decompress_continue(stream))) if (streamState != DENSITY_STREAM_STATE_STALL_ON_INPUT)
        fprintf(stderr, "Error %i occured during decompression\n", streamState);
    if ((streamState = density_stream_decompress_finish(stream)))
        fprintf(stderr, "Error %i occured while finishing compression\n", streamState);
    printf("%llu bytes >> %llu bytes\n", *stream->in_total_read, *stream->out_total_written);

    // Free memory
    density_stream_destroy(stream);
    
    free(outCompressed);
    free(outDecompressed);

And that's it ! We've done a compression/decompression round trip with a few lines !
