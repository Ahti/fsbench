revert changes that moved checking of codecs not being null from test() to main(). Some codecs only update their endcode()/decode() later, so they can't be used now... 
small_iters problem: in-place and buffered codecs that overwrite their input (all but checksums) encode the given data only during the 1st small_iter. Possible solutions:
* drop si; instead of N si have N copies of data stored in RAM
* forbid si>1 for codecs where it doesn't work
* add memcpy where it's needed (very bad for checksums because they are too fast) 

make lzwc work with multiple blocks

Allow more than 1 option passed to a codec, i.e. tor:10:ht4
