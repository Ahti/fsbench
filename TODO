small_iters problem: in-place and buffered codecs that overwrite their input (all but checksums) encode the given data only during the 1st small_iter. Possible solutions:
* drop si; instead of N si have N copies of data stored in RAM
* forbid si>1 for codecs where it doesn't work
* add memcpy where it's needed (very bad for checksums because they are too fast) 

make lzwc work with multiple blocks
update lz4
add mmini-lzh
add http://code.google.com/p/variablelengthstringhashing/ 
* with a fast PRNG (xorshift?)
* with a fast crypto PRNG
* with a static precomputed random sequence
add hashes from http://www.fastcrypto.org/

* Sanmayce's hashes - there's SSE version that doesn't compile with GCC and could be ported
* reintroduce LZ4bz

Allow more than 1 option passed to a codec, i.e. tor:10:ht4
